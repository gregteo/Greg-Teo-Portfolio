# [Project 1: Applied Data Science Capstone Project](https://github.com/gregteo/IBM-Data-Science/blob/master/Coursera%20Capstone%20Project.ipynb)

Project incorporated several data science techniques to find the optimal location based on several criterias. It will also list several other choices that each of which will have their advantages and disadvantages compared to the best possible location.

#### Data sources & Tools used in this project:
 * Neighbourhoods data from wikipidea or other webpages by web scraping using **BeautifulSoup**
 * Latitude and longitude of neighbourhoods using Google Maps **Geodcoding API**
 * Number and type of restaurant in an area using **Foursquare API**
 * **K-means Clustering**
